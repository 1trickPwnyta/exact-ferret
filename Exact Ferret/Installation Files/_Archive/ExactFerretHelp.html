		<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to Exact Ferret, and thank you for downloading and installing! If you 
			don't know already, Exact Ferret is a computer program that takes control of 
			your desktop background (and/or lock screen background if you desire) and 
			displays completely random images downloaded from the Internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			As of Exact Ferret version 2.0, all the details of setting up Exact Ferret are 
			taken care of automatically when you install. In fact, right after you 
			installed Exact Ferret, you should have seen your desktop background change. 
			This means that it is working! Also as of version 2.0, there are many ways to 
			customize Exact Ferret (see <a href="#Settings">Settings</a> below for 
			details). 
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="Requirements">System Requirements</h2>
		<p>
			There are no real hardware requirements for running Exact Ferret. However, 
			there are a few software requirements. If your computer does not meet these 
			requirements, you will not be allowed to install Exact Ferret.
			<ul>
				<li>64-bit Windows 7 operating system or higher</li>
				<li>Microsoft .NET Framework v4.0.30319</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" target="newtab">Image Magick</a> image editor (only required for Windows 7)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="History">Version History</h2>
    <h3>3.0.0 (02-21-2014)</h3>
    <p>
      The initial release of Exact Ferret 3.0. Exact Ferret was rewritten in C# .NET for better Windows 
      operating system integration. The settings window was completely redesigned and several new 
      features were added:
        <ul>
          <li>All settings can now be imported and exported so that you can switch between different 
          settings easily.</li>
          <li>The Exact Ferret background process can now be started and stopped from the settings window.</li>
          <li>Environment variables can be used in file system paths (like the log folder path).</li>
          <li>The time limit for HTTP requests can be controlled.</li>
          <li>The wallpaper style (Center, Stretch, etc) can be controlled, or Exact Ferret can determine 
          a style automatically.</li>
          <li>You can choose a different dictionary file instead of using the default.</li>
          <li>Image size maximums can be specified.</li>
          <li>Google search options for image colors and types can be used.</li>
          <li>Log level options have changed. Trace no longer outputs the Google search results, and new 
          levels Warning and Results have been added. Results outputs everything, including Google search 
          results.</li>
          <li>HTTP proxies no longer need to be specified. Exact Ferret uses the system proxy settings as 
          defined in Control Panel &gt; Internet Options.</li>
          <li>Windows 8 lock screen background changes work more reliably.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
		<h3>2.0.1 (02-04-2014)</h3>
		<p>
			General security improvements, fixed bug in uninstallation process that could prevent 
			automatic updates from working correctly when re-installed.
		</p>
    <h3>2.0.0 (01-18-2014)</h3>
    <p>
      The initial release of Exact Ferret 2.0.
    </p>
		
		<h2 id="Run">How to Run Exact Ferret</h2>
		<p>
			There are two ways to run Exact Ferret. The first way is to simply do nothing. 
			After you install Exact Ferret, it starts running immediately. You should see 
			your desktop wallpaper change right after installing, assuming everything is 
			working. Exact Ferret will continue to run in the background, changing your 
			desktop wallpaper every 15 minutes by default.
		</p>
		<p>
			The other way to run Exact Ferret is to use the Quick Run shortcut. The Quick 
			Run shortcut changes your background immediately, and you can run it whenever 
			you want. For example, if Exact Ferret running in the background changes your 
			background to something appalling, you can use the Quick Run shortcut to change 
			your background again right away. The Quick Run shortcut can be found at Start 
			&gt; All apps &gt; Exact Ferret &gt; Exact Ferret - Quick Run.
		</p>
		
		<h2 id="Settings">Settings</h2>
		<p>
			As of Exact Ferret version 2.0, there are many settings that you can configure 
			in order to customize the behavior of Exact Ferret. To access the settings for 
			Exact Ferret, go to Start &gt; All apps &gt; Exact Ferret &gt; Exact Ferret.
		</p>
    <h3>General Settings</h3>
    <h4>Start Exact Ferret when I log into Windows</h4>
    <p>
      This will automatically start the Exact Ferret background process when you log 
      into Windows. Without this option enabled, you will have to start Exact Ferret manually.
    </p>
		<h4>Install updates automatically</h4>
		<p>
			Selecting this option will tell Exact Ferret to check online for updates to 
			itself. Exact Ferret will check for updates every time it changes your 
			background. If an update is available, you will be prompted to install it.
		</p>
    <h3>Behavior Settings</h3>
		<h4>Run Exact Ferret every ? minutes</h4>
		<p>
			This tells Exact Ferret how many minutes to wait between each time it changes 
			your background. Note that if you set this to 0, Exact Ferret will continuously 
			change your background.
		</p>
    <h4>Save picture files to</h4>
    <p>
      This setting tells Exact Ferret what folder to save downloaded image files in.
      You can take a look in this folder to see the last image Exact Ferret
      downloaded as well as older image files that were already used.
    </p>
    <h4>Number of old pictures to keep before deleting</h4>
    <p>
      When Exact Ferret downloads an image file from the Internet, it stores that
      file in a certain folder. This setting tells Exact Ferret how many previously
      downloaded image files it should keep in that folder. If there are too many
      images in the folder, Exact Ferret will delete the oldest ones.
    </p>
    <h4>HTTP request timeout</h4>
    <p>
      Sets a time limit in seconds to wait on an HTTP request before giving up and 
      moving on. If your network is particularly slow, increase this setting.
    </p>
    <h4>Number of download attempts before giving up</h4>
    <p>
      Sometimes Exact Ferret will encounter an error when it tries to download an
      image from the Internet. When it does, it tries to download a different image.
      This setting tells Exact Ferret how many times to retry before giving up. This
      prevents Exact Ferret from getting stuck trying to download images and getting
      errors every single time. This would be the case if you do not have an Internet
      connection, for example.
    </p>
    <h4>Change desktop wallpaper</h4>
    <p>
      There are two backgrounds that Exact Ferret can change: Your desktop background
      and your lock screen background (this is the screen you see when you are
      logging into your computer, or when you lock it). This setting tells Exact Ferret 
      to change your desktop wallpaper. You may additionally specify the wallpaper 
      style (Stretch, Tile, etc), or select Automatic. When Automatic is selected, Exact 
      Ferret determines the best style to use for each picture.
    </p>
    <h4>Change lock screen background</h4>
    <p>
      There are two backgrounds that Exact Ferret can change: Your desktop background
      and your lock screen background (this is the screen you see when you are
      logging into your computer, or when you lock it). This setting tells Exact Ferret
      to change your lock screen background.
    </p>
    <h3>Search Settings</h3>
    <h4>Dictionary file</h4>
    <p>
      Tells Exact Ferret where to find the dictionary file. For more information about 
      the dictionary file, see <a href="#Dictionary">The Dictionary File</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Search term modifier</h4>
    <p>
      Exact Ferret uses Google Image Search to search for images on the Internet.
      Words you put in this setting will be added to the end of each search term
      Exact Ferret uses. You can use this to &quot;bias&quot; the downloaded images
      toward a certain theme. For example, in the month of December, you can set this
      to <em>christmas</em>. This will make it more likely that Exact Ferret will
      download Christmas-themed images.
    </p>
		<h4>Image size range</h4>
		<p>
			This setting specifies the minimum and maximum size of downloaded images, in 
      pixels. Exact Ferret will not download any images outside this range.
		</p>
		<h4>Minimum width:height ratio range</h4>
		<p>
			An image's width:height ratio is the number you get when you divide its width 
			by its height. For example, a standard 800x600 pixel image has a width:height 
			ratio of 1.3. You can use this setting to make sure that Exact Ferret only 
			downloads images which have a similar width:height ratio to your screen.
		</p>
		<h4>Colors in image</h4>
		<p>
			This setting uses Google's image color search setting to search for images 
      of a certain color.
		</p>
    <h4>Type of image</h4>
    <p>
      This setting uses Google's image type search setting to search for images
      of a certain type, such as photos or clip art.
    </p>
		<h4>Use Google's safe search feature</h4>
		<p>
			Exact Ferret uses Google Image Search to search for images to download. Select 
			this option to turn on Google's Safe Search option, which helps prevent naughty 
			images from appearing in search results, and thus helps prevent Exact Ferret 
			from using such images as your background.
		</p>
		<h4>Search domain</h4>
		<p>
			This setting uses Google's domain search option to only search a single 
			Internet domain (such as www.flickr.com). This setting is very restrictive, so 
			don't be surprised if Exact Ferret can't find any images to download after you 
			set this option.
		</p>
    <h3>Log Settings</h3>
    <h4>Log file location</h4>
    <p>
      Exact Ferret keeps track of everything it does in the log file. This setting
      tells Exact Ferret where the log file is. If you ever need to troubleshoot a
      problem with Exact Ferret, the log file is a good place to look. It is also
      helpful to look at the log to figure out where Exact Ferret downloaded an image
      from, or what it searched the Internet for in order to find that image.
    </p>
    <h4>Log file rolls over at ? KB</h4>
    <p>
      This setting tells Exact Ferret when to stop writing information in the log
      file and start a new log file. Setting a limit here prevents log files from
      getting too large (a log file that is too large would be very difficult for
      you to open in a program such as Notepad). If you don't know what a KB is,
      just leave this setting at the default. It's fine.
    </p>
    <h4>Log level</h4>
    <p>
      This setting controls what kind of information is written into the log file.
      If you are troubleshooting a problem with Exact Ferret and the normal
      information in the log isn't enough to help you narrow down the problem, you
      can try setting this to Trace or Results. Results will log the maximum 
      information. Always be sure to set this back to something else, like Info, 
      when you're done, though. Leaving this setting on Results, or even Trace, 
      generates <strong>a lot</strong> of information in the log file and will start 
      to consume a lot of disk space.
    </p>
    <h3>Other Options</h3>
    <h4>Import and export settings</h4>
    <p>
      From the File menu, you can export your current settings to a file. Then you can 
      change your settings however you want, and later you can import your old settings 
      back from the file. This allows you to configure Exact Ferret in several different 
      ways and switch between them easily.
    </p>
		
		<h2 id="Dictionary">The Dictionary File</h2>
		<p>
			The dictionary file is a text file that Exact Ferret uses to come up with 
			things to search the Internet for. Exact Ferret picks a random word from the 
			dictionary file and uses it as a Google Image Search to find images. The 
			included dictionary file has 80,000+ words in it. You can add more (such as 
			names of people or places) if you'd like. You can also remove some. You can 
			even replace the entire contents of the dictionary file with a totally new 
			set of words or phrases that you want Exact Ferret to use. If you are 
			interested in this, you can find the dictionary file in Exact Ferret's 
			installation directory. It is called <em>dictionary.txt</em>. If you do not 
      want to modify the original dictionary file, you can instead create your own 
      dictionary file and tell Exact Ferret to use it instead (in the settings window).

		<h2 id="FAQ">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
    <div class="question">
      Q: Will Exact Ferret damage my computer or give me viruses?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      A: Yes, of course. But that's what you get for ignoring the Windows warning about 
      unverified software. Actually, no, Exact Ferret will not hurt your computer. It 
      is okay to ignore any warnings about the software. The most dangerous thing 
      Exact Ferret does is download and execute installer files for automatic updates. 
      However, this is safe because the download is secure and the identity of the 
      update server is checked to ensure you are downloading from a safe source. Also, 
      please note that image files downloaded from the Internet cannot harm your computer 
      either. And just in case some goon out there posts an "image" which is really an 
      executable virus, there is no need to worry because Exact Ferret will not 
      execute it. In fact, if Exact Ferret determines the file to not be a valid image 
      file, it will delete it.
    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Q: My background isn't changing! Why isn't it working?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      A: First, check to make sure Exact Ferret is running (you can see this in the settings 
      window). Then, again in the settings window, make sure Exact Ferret is configured to 
      set the background you are concerned about. If everything looks good, check the log file 
      (you can find the location of the log file in the settings window). If the log file has 
      any errors, there may be some operating system changes you need to make in order to 
      get Exact Ferret to work (like maybe enabling your Internet connection). If you still 
      can't get it to work, set your log level to Results, perform a Quick Run, and send an email 
      with your latest log file to <a href="mailto:danielpace6@gmail.com&subject=Exact Ferret">
      danielpace6@gmail.com</a>.
