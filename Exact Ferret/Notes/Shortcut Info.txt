Use ShortcutUtil to create shortcuts with hotkeys when hotkeys are needed.
To determine if the hotkey exists, pass the shortcut to getShortcutHotKey.
If the result is 0 or -1 (not found), there is no hot key. Otherwise there is.
For specific hot keys:
Ctrl+Alt+P: 1616
Ctrl+Alt+Q: 1617
Ctrl+Alt+A: 1601
Ctrl+Alt+B: 1602
